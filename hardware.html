<h2>What is a motherboard?</h2>

<p> The motherboard of a computer is generally referred to as
the core and heart of a computer. It contains all of the basic
components and circuitry of the computer. One of the most common
models of motherboards is the AT motherboard, though a newer model;
the ATX motherboard exists, and both models have the same basic
components. <br> Motherboards have a decently long history
and chain of evolution from throughout the years. <br> In 1975,
Apple introduced their first product, which would become 
known as the Apple I. The device consisted of 
keyboard, motherboard, and a display. <br> Then, in 1987 
The Elitegroup Computer Systems Co. became the largest motherboard
supplier around. Not long after, in 1989, AsusTek began making 
graphic cards.

 <h2> What is RAM? </h2>
 
 <p> One of the most simple ways of explaining comparing it to
 short term memory. In people&rsquo;s brains, short term memory
 is where the information at hand is stored for a short amount 
 of time, it is how people remember points of a conversation 
 and continue it. RAM functions in a very similar way, it is
 where all the current data and apps currently in use are 
 stored. Once the computer is turned off, all the data 
 on the RAM is lost and then restored when the computer <br> 
 Just like all other parts that make up computers,
 RAM has gone through a decent amount of evolution. Initially,
 RAM was asynchronous, but this eventually became too inefficient
 and couldn&rsquo;t keep up with how processors were becoming more 
 and more powerful. Thus, the introduction of SDRAM 
 (synchronous dynamic random access memory) in the 1990s 
 allowed for clock speeds to be synchronized. A decade later, 
 another big step in evolution of RAM had to be taken,
 and DDR RAM (double data rate random access memory) was developed. 
 Since then, there have been a few incarnations of DDR RAM 
 (DDR2, DDR3, DDR4), each one improving in efficiency from the last
