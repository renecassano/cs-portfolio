<h2>What is a Motherboard?</h2>

<p> The motherboard of a computer is generally referred to as
the core and heart of a computer. It contains all of the basic
components and circuitry of the computer. One of the most common
models of motherboards is the AT motherboard, though a newer model;
the ATX motherboard exists, and both models have the same basic
components. <br> Motherboards have a decently long history
and chain of evolution from throughout the years. <br> In 1975,
Apple introduced their first product, which would become 
known as the Apple I. The device consisted of a
keyboard, motherboard, and a display. <br> Then, in 1987 
The Elitegroup Computer Systems Co. became the largest motherboard
supplier around. Not long after, in 1989, AsusTek began making 
graphic cards.

 <h2> What is RAM? </h2>

 alt=RAM RAM width=400 height=270>
 
 <p> One of the most simple ways of explaining is comparing it to
 short term memory. In people&rsquo;s brains, short term memory
 is where the information at hand is stored for a short amount 
 of time, it is how people remember points of a conversation 
 and continue it. RAM functions in a very similar way, it is
 where all the current data and apps currently in use are 
 stored. Once the computer is turned off, all the data 
 on the RAM is lost and then restored when the computer 
 is turned back on <br> 
 Just like all other parts that make up computers,
 RAM has gone through a decent amount of evolution. Initially,
 RAM was asynchronous, but this eventually became too inefficient
 and couldn&rsquo;t keep up with how processors were becoming more 
 and more powerful. Thus, the introduction of SDRAM 
 (synchronous dynamic random access memory) in the 1990s 
 allowed for clock speeds to be synchronized. A decade later, 
 another big step in evolution of RAM had to be taken,
 and DDR RAM (double data rate random access memory) was developed. 
 Since then, there have been a few incarnations of DDR RAM 
 (DDR2, DDR3, DDR4), each one improving in efficiency from the last

  <h2> What is a CPU? </h2>

  alt=central processing unit width=400 height=270>
  
  <p> The CPU is the part of the computer that is interprets and 
  executes a large number of commands from a computer's other 
  hardware and software. CPU stands for Central Processing Unit, 
  a now very evidently apt name, especially because the CPU has 
  nicknames like "the brains of the computer" . Just about all sorts 
  of technology, including smartphones and flat screen televisions.
  The central processing unit consists of two main parts: the 
  arithmetic/logic unit and the control unit. The contrl unit has 
  circuitry that sends electrical signals to direct other parts of the
  computer to execute or carry out some instructions. The arithmetic/logic
  unit (ALU) executes all arithmetic and logical operations. The ALU can
  perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Logical 
  operations are typically making a comparison and determines whether 
  something is equal to, less than and greater than something else. </p>

    <h2> What is Hard Drive? </h2>

alt=Hard drive width=400 height=270>
  
  <p> The hard disk drive is the primary hardware data storage piece in a computer.
  The hard drive is basically made up of circular disks stacked on top of eachother.
  A small arm type of things moves over the disks and writes information on them.
  The hard drive can also be referred to as: HDD, fixed drive, fixed disk drive,
  fixed disk, C drive, etc. </p>

  <h2> What is BUS? </h2>

  alt=BUS width=400 height=270>
  
  <p> In the world of computing, a BUS is a series of physical cables, circuits etc.
  between the different parts of a computer that create a sort of "data highway".
  There are many types of buses. The different types include frontside Bus, 
  which decides data transfer rate speed and is the main transferway for 
  the CPU, RAM, and various other motherboard parts. Another variant is the
  system bus that helps with communication between the CPU and memory. Other
  types of buses are internal, external, expansion, and backside.</p>
