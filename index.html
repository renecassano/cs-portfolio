<h1> About Me </h1>

<h2>  My School  </h2> 

<p> I currently attend Summit Shasta High School as a junior.
It&rsquo;s a charter school in California that has only been
around for a few years and has a small number of students 
under 500. I have been attending the school since the beginning
of my freshman year and plan to graduate from it next year.
 </p>

<h2>  Places I'm From/Have Been To </h2>

<p> While I was born and raised in Daly City, CA, 
my ancestors are largely from Bolivia and El Salvador. 
Most of my family from my mother&rsquo;s side is from El Salvador
and a large portion of them still are in El Salvador, with
a handful of my mother&rsquo;s siblings and their families 
currently in the US. My father&rsquo;s family hails from Bolivia,
with some Italian blood from when my Italian great grandfather
moved to the country. I have been to both of my parents&rsquo;
home countries, and I have also been to places in the US, 
such as Florida, Washington DC, Lake Tahoe, etc.
 </p>


<h2>  Favorite Things </h2>

<p> I find it difficult to name my favorite "_____", but CURRENTLY,
a few of my favorite albums are "I don&rsquo;t like shit, I don&rsquo;t go outside"
by Earl Sweatshirt, and "Blonde", by Frank Ocean. I don&rsquo;t 
generally have a defined favorite movie, but Reservoir Dogs always
comes to mind, and some of my favorite movies of the year are
The Nice Guys, Hell or High Water, and Deadpool.  </p>

<h2> Hobbies/Interests </h2>

I don&rsquo;t do much outside of school other than normal things
like going out with family and friends and sleeping. 
Other than that, i spend a large amount of time on the internet,
watching movies/TV and playing videogames alone or with friends.
A major interest of mine lately has been psychology, I&rsquo;ve 
been reading a decent amount of articles and papers talking about
various subjects within the field of psychology.
