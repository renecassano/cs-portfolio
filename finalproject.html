    <p> The Academy Awards are an 89 year old hollywood annual ceremony that honors
    and awards achievements in film every year that is hosted by the Academy of Motion 
    Picture Arts and Sciences. The very first Academy Awards ceremony was held 
    on May 16, 1929, predating the mass production of penicillin by 
    14 years and postdating the birth of Betty White by 7. The Academy Awards 
    ceremony, or the Oscars, is broadcasted live on television every year, graciously
    allowing those at home to gawk at the much more attractive-than-them and filthily
    rich celebrities on the red carpet, recognize some of the year’s greatest films 
    and filmmakers, and laugh with simultaneous shock at the oh so rare but precious
    moments of severe blunders during the broadcast. Such mistakes include 
    (but are not limited to) using a photo of the wrong person during the 
    “In Memoriam” sequence, announcing the wrong winner for the Best Picture award
    (both just this past year!), horribly mispronouncing names, and the list goes on.
    A whole website could probably be committed to these kinds of mistakes, but 
    unfortunately that is not the main point of this website.

    <p> As I said previously, the 
    Oscars were established in 1929. This first ceremony was held at a private 
    party being held at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, where there was an audience of about 270 people, and 15 awards were
    handed out. Funnily enough, this first Oscars ceremony ran for a measly <b>15
    minutes</b>! That is nothing compared to the sometimes tiring average running 
    time of 2-3 hours since the event was first televised in 1953. The crowd is
    also tiny compared to how many people usually attend the Oscars now. 
    The ceremony is held at the Dolby Theater, which has a seating capacity of 
    about 3,401, and just about every seat is taken at the ceremony! All this is
    funny to think about, the now cultural staple started as a very small and 
    personal event in the late 20s. Back then, TV wasn’t even a thing, so you 
    couldn’t see all the awkward interviews on the red carpet and the massive crowds
    and stunts at the ceremony.The Academy has a voting membership of around 6,000
    people, all members of the Academy and a part of a specific discipline of film
    and its corresponding branch of the Academy. In 2012 the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> conducted
    a study that basically found that the Oscars were extremely white, with an
    astounding 94% of the Academy being Caucasian. As you might find in my writing 
    on some of the categories though, there has been a lot 
    of effort to try and fix the race issues, and there was much more diverse racial representation this year. Regardless of some of its issues, the ceremony has been
    a large part of American and film culture in general since its introduction,
    and was the basis for all of its just as huge later equivalent awards shows
    (Emmy Awards, Tony Awards, and Grammy Awards). Now, what I originally had planned for 
    this website was the above sort of introductory and summary thing and then writing below 
    on what was goin' on in each category this past year. However, I quickly realized I only had about a week and half 
    for this project, and there were <b>24</b> Oscar categories to write about, and I was planning 
    on writing at least two paragraphs for each. So, I decided to not torture myself and only 
    write about the six biggest categories:

    alt="BEST PICTURE NOMINEES" width="620" height="360"> 
    

    <p> Obviously the biggest award of the ceremony, the Best Picture award is 
    for the greatest films of the year as wholes. The rules regarding the number of nominees allowed 
    each year has an interesting and kind of confusing history, but it goes like
    this: In the 30s and 40s up to 8-12 films could be nominated for Best Picture
    in a year. Afterwards, only 5 films could be nominated, at least until 2009! 
    In 2009 the Academy announced that the number of nominees a year would go from
    5 to 10. Just two years later though, this was changed so that <b>between</b> 5 and
    10 films could be nominated. Just last year, only nine films were nominated 
    for the big prize. This seems to be working for the Academy, although just 
    last year there was some discontent with the 10th slot not being filled by a 
    film they thought deserved it, such as <i>Deadpool</i>, or <i>Sing Street</i>. Unfortunately
    this is just how all the math that elects the final nominees that I don’t care
    to explain works out. 5-10 films can be nominated, and the number can easily 
    fall anywhere in between. 
    </p>
    
    <p>  Nine really cool films were nominated for best picture. It was the typical 
    sort of dramas, history pieces and, smaller more personal projects that got the 
    nomination. The films nominated were: <i>Arrival, Fences, Hacksaw Ridge, Hell or 
    High Water, Manchester By The Sea, Hidden Figures, La La Land, Lion,</i> and the 
    ultimate winner of the little naked gold dude statuette, <i>Moonlight</i>. There were a
    lot of easy jokes made by this year’s host, Jimmy Kimmel, at the ceremony about 
    how most people probably didn’t see these pictures. Heck, here I am writing a whole
    website on the Oscars and the 2017 show and even I’ve only seen 7.5/9 of the movies.
    But from what I saw, I can tell ya these were all some pretty cool movies! They were
    all beautiful visually, in terms of story, acting ETC.

    <h3> THE BIGGEST MESS UP IN OSCAR HISTORY!!! </h3>
    <!-- h3 creates the third biggest type of header.-->
    <p> It was the very end of the ceremony. Everyone in the room was probably just
    waiting for the final award, Best Picture, to be done with and go home or to some
    crazy Hollywood after party. LITTLE DID THEY KNOW WHAT WAS ABOUT TO GO DOWN. Faye
    Dunaway and Warren Beatty were announcing the winner. Warren Beatty was holding 
    the envelope Warren Beatty looked down at the piece of paper a lot like how you 
    might look down at an odd looking cat, but you don’t want to say anything because
    it’s your friend’s new cat and they’ve been excited about getting a cat for months,
    so you just try to play it nice and safe. Like, it looks like there might actually 
    be something medically wrong with the cat but you don’t want to be rude. Anyway, 
    Beatty then decided to just hand the paper off to Dunaway and let her read it to 
    everyone. She then quickly announced the winner as <i>La La Land</i>. The director, stars,
    producers and everyone representing <i>La La Land</i> got up on stage to give all of their
    speeches. About 2 ½ producers got through their speeches, when someone people from 
    backstage got on stage. Everyone representing <i> La La Land</i>was sadly giving back 
    their Oscars in the background after thinking they won something they probably dreamt about all their lives while
    a producer of <i>La La Land</i>, Jordan Horowitz, had to announce that there was a mess-up, 
    and <i>Moonlight</i> had actually won Best Picture. </p>
    
    <img style="border-style:solid; border-width:3px; border-color:#B7A261;" src="http://img.wennermedia.com/featured/jordan-horowitz-la-la-land-producer-talks-mistake-oscars-152251c0-7941-4362-870a-e5fb5f10e7f0.jpg" 
    alt="Horowitz corrects mess-up" width="400" height="300">
    <figcaption> Justin Horowitz holding up the <b>correct</b> paper declaring <i>Moonlight</i> as the real winner </figcaption>
    
   <p> Originally, I had thought it was some cruel
    joke. <i>La La Land</i> had been the favorite to win the award all awards season, and <i>Moonlight</i> was usually listed as
     the close second. Because of this, in the first minute of confusion, I had assumed
    Jimmy Kimmel was working off of this and decided to have <i>La La Land</i> falsely announced before
    <i>Moonlight</i>. This made sense to me because of a combination of all the stuff Kimmel had been 
    doing all night, the tasteless (but still admittedly funny) stuff some other people had done
    in previous years, and the minor shock at how something so simple could be messed up. My thoughts
    during the ceremony were “Damn, too far Kimmel, too far!!” However, i soon realized how ridiculous this was and that it was not 
    the case, and Kimmel probably wouldn’t have the authority or support to do something as crazy like that.
     </p>
     
     <p>What actually went down and how the mess-up happened was mostly revealed 
     the next day. Beatty had been handed the wrong envelope backstage. The 
     envelope he had was actually a back-up envelope with Emma Stone’s name as the
     winner for Best Actress for her role in <i>La La Land</i>, which was announced earlier
     in the ceremony (MORE ON THAT AFTER). After Beatty confusingly gave the envelope
     to Dunaway, she just saw “<i>La La Land</i>” and blurted that out. This whole situation
     was HUGE on social media. People on twitter were having a field day making memes
     out of it all, and media outlets unreasonably chose to focus on Beatty as the 
     big culprit and buffoon. The Best Picture mess-up boosted an otherwise pretty
     good ceremony into being on the front of Oscars history and the top pick for
     every blogger’s “Top 10 Biggest Blunders in Oscar History!” list that following week.

        <h2> BEST LEADING ACTOR </h2>
        
        <p> Just as with a lot of the Oscar categories in 2017 and in general,
        “Best Actor in a Leading Role” was a pretty competitive category. The 
        nominees were: Andrew Garfield, for his role in <i>Hacksaw Ridge</i>, Denzel 
        Washington for his role in <i>Fences</i>, Ryan Gosling for his role in 
        <i>La La Land</i>, Viggo Mortensen for his role in <i>Captain Fantastic</i>, and the
        category’s winner: Casey Affleck for his role in <i>Manchester by the Sea</i>. 
        </p>
        
        <img style="border-style:solid; border-width:3px; border-color:#B7A261;" src="https://dailycrusadernewsdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/2017-01-24t171446z_1_lynxmped0n16r_rtroptp_4_us-awards-oscars-nominations.jpg" 
    alt="Best Leading Actor nominees" width="400" height="300">
    <figcaption>Pictured from left to right: Casey Affleck, Andrew Garfield, Ryan Gosling, Viggo Mortensen, and Denzel Washington. 
</figcaption>
    
    <p> During awards season, Casey and Denzel were the favorites to win the award.
    For some time closer to the ceremony date though, some legal issues came back 
    to haunt Casey Affleck. Around 2010, two women who had worked on Affleck’s 2010 
    mockumentary <i>I’m Still Here</i>, Amanda White and Magdalena Gorka filed lawsuits 
    against him for sexual harassment over filming of the mockumentary. The two women 
    recounted all sorts of instances of sexual harassment from Affleck and the film crew 
    that went from saying things like “Isn’t it about time you got pregnant?” to Affleck 
    drunkenly crawling into Gorka’s bed in the middle of the night while she slept. 
    Both cases were eventually settled out of court, so there was no verdict or 
    substantiation of the claims, and details of the settlements were not released 
    to the public. Still, people on the internet framed it as a black-and-white case,
    portraying Affleck as a monster sneaking his way through Hollywood. The cases 
    did greatly muddle Affleck’s reputation amongst some circles, and also seemingly, 
    his chances of winning. Not only did this draw a lot of controversy and attention 
    towards Affleck, it also earned some backlash against the Academy after eventually 
    handing him his Oscar. </p>

<p>The run between Affleck and Washington was actually really interesting because
of how differently they acted in both of their movies. Denzel was very loud and
showy role with all of his character’s emotions fully on display, 
while Affleck was much quieter and subtle in his performance. Overall, 2017’s
Best Leading Actor race was a two-man race between two very dissimilar performances,
with three other extraordinary actors that will hopefully win their Oscars in the future.

            <h2> BEST LEADING ACTRESS </h2>
            
            <p> 2017’s Best Leading Actress race was one of the categories that 
            seemed to have a clear winner from the start. The nominees were: 
            Ruth Negga for her role in <i>Loving</i>, Natalie Portman for <i>Jackie</i>, a rare
            nomination for a performance in a French film: Isabelle Huppert for 
            <i>Elle</i>, Meryl Streep for <i>Florence Foster Jenkins</i>, and the obvious winner
            from the start, Emma Stone for <i>La La Land</i>. </p>

    <img style="border-style:solid; border-width:3px; border-color:#B7A261;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/oscars-img-abc/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/27164226/129a159b7e1d404fc9a6ce27454fe27eb62115dad2c2f20d3c33c38650cf636a-770x443.jpg?t=1485535804"

    <figcaption> Pictured from left to right: Isabelle Huppert, Ruth Negga, Natalie Portman, Emma Stone, and Meryl Streep</figcaption>
    
    <p>Stone was a favorite for a variety of reasons. <i>La La Land</i> received massive 
    critical acclaim unlike that of all of the movie’s of the other actresses in the 
    category (<i>La La Land</i> broke the record for most Golden Globes wins), 
    which boosts the chances of the movie’s actors winning awards vastly, and she
    was winning all of the other awards, like a Golden Globe and SAG award, 
    which are strongly correlated with who wins the Oscar. Also, even though one 
    might consider her a sort of underdog for being in a foreign film (nobody really likes subtitles),
    Isabelle Huppert was considered Stone’s biggest competitor by some. This was due to Huppert also
    winning Best Leading Actress at the Golden Globes (there’s one drama category and a comedy/musical
    category for leading actors, Huppert won the award for drama and Stone won the musical category).
    So, even though <i>La La Land</i> lost the Best Picture award, Stone could luckily still go home with a statuette. </p>

            <p>Again, the winner seemed to be pretty easy to predict from the 
            get-go. The nominees were: Denis Villeneuve for <i>Arrival</i>, Barry 
            Jenkins for <i>Moonlight</i>, Kenneth Lonergan for <i>Manchester by the Sea</i>, 
            Mel Gibson for <i>Hacksaw Ridge</i>, and the winner, Damien Chazelle for <i>La La Land</i>. </p>

    <p>The only other film Damien Chazelle wrote and directed himself that got a 
    wide-release was 2014’s <i>Whiplash</i>. It was one of the best movies of 
    the year, and earned the director a lot of acclaim and the film earned 5 
    Academy Award nominations, 3 of which it won. Chazelle’s history with the 
    Academy, combined with the impressive beauty and mastery of <i>La La Land</i>,
    and the fact that the movie centered around one of Hollywood’s favorite subjects:
    Hollywood made him the favorite to win. Damien Chazelle also became the youngest
    person to ever win “Best Director”, he was only 32 when he won. All of the other
    directors also made amazing and thought-provoking films. Mel Gibson produced 
    very striking images of war that helped the viewer feel as if they were on the battlefield,
    Lonergan very much utilized the setting of Manchester-by-the-Sea as its own identifiable
    character, and got amazing performances out of the actors. Jenkins used cinematic
    methods and created images to create a very distinct and beautiful style for his movie,
    and Villeneuve again proved his brilliance by making one of the most intriguing 
    and thought-provoking films of the year.

            <h2> BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR </h2>
            
            <p>Another easy lock for the award, Best Supporting Actor didn’t
            spark too much debate on who would win. Nominees in the category 
            this year were Jeff Bridges, for his role in <i>Hell or High Water</i>,
            Lucas Hedges for his role in <i>Manchester by the Sea</i>, Dev Patel for 
            his role in </i>Lion</i>, Michael Shannon for his role in <i>Nocturnal Animals</i>
            and the winner, Mahershala Ali for his role in <i>Moonlight</i>. </p>

    <p>While all of the actors delivered fine and memorable performances, Ali 
    seemed to stick with people more than everyone else. Ali portrayed a sort 
    of “drug dealer with a heart of gold” in the first third of <i>Moonlight</i> - 
    before the movie moved onto the other 2 pivotal points of the main character’s 
    life being depicted in the film - Ali acted as a sort of father figure 
    to Little during his screen time, and made viewers wonder where the heck he
    went when he didn’t appear in the rest of the movie with almost no explanation.
    I haven’t seen <i>Lion</i> still, which is the movie Dev Patel was in, but 
    from what I’ve heard, it’s arguable whether Patel was a leading or supporting
    actor in the film. With ensemble movies, a lot of actors that had bigger parts
    in movies can sneak into the supporting actor category if the competition in
    the category seems less threatening than whoever is up for the leading actor
    category. This was definitely the case with Viola Davis this year, she was in
    <i>Fences</i>, which I actually did see but more on that in the supporting actress category! </p>

    <p>Lucas Hedges and Jeff Bridges also delivered strong performances in their 
    films. Both roles had a specific moment/scene where they really got to show 
    off their acting chops that could probably be credited with earning them the
    Oscar nods. Michael Shannon was extremely compelling as detective Bobby Andes,
    and what drew almost as much attention as his performance was the fact that
    he got the nomination over his co-star, Aaron Taylor-Johnson,who actually 
    won the Golden Globe for best supporting actor in a drama the month prior
    to the Oscars. So there was some confusion over why Shannon then got the 
    nomination for the Oscar. </p>

    <p> While there is some overlap in voters between the Golden Globes and the 
    Oscars, they do consist of different members, so I guess Oscar people just 
    liked Shannon more, after all he had been nominated before in 2009. Overall,
    just as with every category almost every year, the Best Supporting Actor 
    category was full of amazing talent. </p>

    <h2>BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS</h2>
    
    <p>Best Supporting Actress was probably the most competitive category of the
    year, with two very even frontrunners and one more actress very close behind
    in terms of amounts of praise and talk the performances generated. The two 
    frontrunners were Viola Davis for <i>Fences</i> and Michelle Williams for
    <i>Manchester by the Sea</i>. Naomie Harris was also in great contention for
    her role in <i>Moonlight</i>, and Nicole Kidman and Octavia Spencer also earned
    nominations for their roles in <i>Lion</i> and <i>Hidden Figures</i> respectively
    (but I still haven’t seen <i>Lion</i> and only half of <i>Hidden Figures</i>). </p>

    <p>As I said, Davis did go on to win the award, but there was some talk over
    whether she belonged in this category in the first place. It’s very easy to 
    argue that she was more of a co-lead rather than a supporting actress alongside Denzel.
    Davis’ agent or whoever probably made a push for her to be put in the supporting
    actress category because the competition was thought to not be as bad as who
    was up for best leading actress. The fact that Viola had way more screen time
    in her film than everyone else in this category gave her a pretty big advantage,
    but nonetheless, you can’t argue that she delivered a great performance, with
    amazing believability, authentic real cry-snot and everything. Michelle Williams
    was actually my own favorite to win, she managed to do a lot and leave a huge 
    impression in the little time she had on screen, and she stole every scene she
    was in. Naomie Harris also did phenomenally in Moonlight, especially once you 
    find out that she only had 3 days to do all of her scenes in the middle of press
    touring for <i>Spectre</i>. I can’t speak much on the other two nominees, as I 
    barely saw the movies they were in, but I’m sure they were great too. </p>
