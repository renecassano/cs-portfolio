    <p>The first section you see in the code is the style tag. This is where you
    make everything look nice and develop the arrangement and elements of 
    everything visible on the page. For example, the addBtn element in the style
    tag determines everything regarding how the actual 'add' button looks. This 
    is what every piece of the style tag does. Next came the short html body 
    section. In the html I just established everything that needed to be on 
    the page. The html contained what the CSS was trying to stylize. The 
    javascript came next and was probably the hardest and most complex part of 
    the code as it often is. Each section of the javascript is already labeled
    with comments explaining their individual jobs. The javascript is sort of 
    what moves all the gears. The HTML contains most of  the items on the page,
    the CSS makes them look nice, and the javascript makes them do what they're
    supposed to do.
