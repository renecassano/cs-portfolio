    <p>The first section you see in the code is the style tag. This is where you
    make everything look nice and develop the arrangement and elements of 
    everything visible on the page. For example, the addBtn element in the style
    tag determines everything regarding how the actual 'add' button looks. The
    background-color element actually changes the background color of the button,
    the color element actually changes the color of the text in the color, and
    the width element manipulates the width of the button that shows up on the
    page. This is what every piece of the style tag does. Next came the short 
    html body section. In the html I just established everything that needed to
    be on the page. The html contained what the CSS was trying to stylize. The 
    javascript came next and was probably the hardest and most complex part of 
    the code as it often is. Each section of the javascript is already labeled
    with comments explaining their individual jobs. The javascript is sort of 
    what moves all the gears. For example, the javascript tells the computer 
    to what class it should change the list to with if/else statement. The HTML 
    contains most of  the items on the page, the CSS makes them look nice (e.g.
    the button colorings), and the javascript makes them do what they're supposed
    to do. Specifically, the if/else statement says that if the list is default,
    then when someone clicks on the list it'll change the class of the list to 
    "strike". Once the class of the list is "strike" onclick, the list's class 
    with change to "black". and when the list's class is "black", it'll change 
    the class of the list to "default" onclick, and cycle continues.
