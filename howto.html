  <h1> How To Page </h1>
  
  <p> Creating a website requires a decent amount of knowledge
  about coding. Some of the things you need to know are: how to 
  import images, how to create different headers and fonts, etc.
  In this page, I will be explaining how I used these various 
  computer science tools. <br>
  One of the first aspects of creating a website you will probably
  encounter is headers. 
  Headers are used to introduce different sections of a page, 
  similar to how they are used in other mediums, e.g. newspapers
  <img src = 
  "https://www.englishclub.com/images/writing/headline.png"  
  alt= Newspaper header width=400 height=270>
  Headers come in different sizes, the largest one being
  &lt;h1&gt; &lt;/h1&gt; and the smallest one is
  &lt;h6&gt; &lt;/h6&gt;. I used headers and titles for all the pages
  I made to better organize the information. 
  Another vital aspect I used was &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p. It's used to 
  create paragraphs and is the tool I used to construct the 
  paragraphs you're reading right now. Just about all of these tags 
  and tools are contained within &lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt;, which is 
  where all the visible words, pictures etc. on the website are 
  stored in the code. Another integral part of creating webpages is images.
  Images are fairly simple to use in html. you start off with a tag like
  &lt;img src=&quot;EXAMPLELINK.COM&quot;&gt;. the EXAMPLELINK.COM space 
  would be filled by whatever the url is for the image you want to use.
  The size of the image can also be changed within the tag. Typing in "width=x" 
  and "height=x" accomplishes just this. Another aspect of the website I 
  had to construct was the navigation bar. The navbar is established with the 
  line &lt;ul id=&quot;navbar&quot;&gt;. inserting a line such as 
  &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;example.html&quot;&gt; Example Page Name &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  underneath the navbar establishing line would then link what ever page I am
  currently making the navbar on to the page example.html, which would be called
  "Example Page Name" on the navbar seen by the viewer. after all li items 
  are typed in, you end the tag with </ul> at the end of everything. 
  The navbar also has to be copy and pasted on every tab you want to be 
  included in your final website. Finally, you also need to create a css file 
  to link to and customize the navbar. Once you know how to utilize all these
  tools, creating a website should be easy from here on out.
